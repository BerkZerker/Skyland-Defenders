# Active Context: Skyland Defenders

## Current Focus
Implementing Phase 1: Core Gameplay Prototype (MVP)

## Recently Completed
- **Enemy Movement**
    - Implemented direct movement towards the closest defender.

## Implementation Order
1. **Defender Placement System** (Current Priority)
    - Grid-based placement
    - Tile validation
    - Basic defender instantiation

2. **Defender Attacking Mechanics**
    - Range-based targeting
    - Basic projectile system
    - Attack cooldown

3. **Enemy Attacking Mechanics**
    - Melee range detection
    - Damage system
    - Attack animations

4. **Resource System**
    - Resource tracking
    - Enemy defeat rewards
    - Placement cost system

5. **Game Loop**
    - Wave spawning system
    - Victory/defeat conditions
    - Game state management

6. **Basic UI**
    - Core game controls
    - Resource display
    - Health/wave indicators

## Active Decisions
1. Using grid-based system for precise placement
2.
3. Using signal system for event handling
4. Centralizing resource management
5. Implementing periodic path recalculation for dynamic updates

## Current Considerations
1. Grid size optimization for mobile
2. Enemy spawn point placement
3. Resource balance for initial prototype
4. UI scaling for different devices
5. Path recalculation frequency optimization
6. Enemy movement smoothing and performance

## Next Steps
1. Set up basic grid system
2. Implement defender placement logic
3. Add placement validation
4. Create basic defender entity

## Technical Notes
- A* pathfinding implementation ensures efficient enemy movement
- Grid system integration allows for precise path calculation
- Path recalculation system handles dynamic obstacle changes
- Enemy movement system includes smooth path following
