# Active Context: Skyland Defenders

## Current Focus
Implementing Phase 1: Core Gameplay Prototype (MVP)

## Recently Completed
- **Grid System Implementation**
    - Grid starts from 0,0 with configurable size
    - 6x6 valid placement area in center
    - All cells drawn as outlines, valid area filled
- **Enemy Movement**
    - Implemented direct movement towards the closest defender
    - Enhanced linear pathing with periodic target updates
    - Added visual path indicators for movement direction
    - Enemies move freely regardless of grid cells
- **Code Indentation Fixed**: Fixed indentation in `scripts/defender.gd` for better readability and code quality.

## Implementation Order
1. **Defender Placement System** (Current Priority)
    - Grid-based placement
    - Tile validation
    - Basic defender instantiation

2. **Defender Attacking Mechanics**
    - Range-based targeting
    - Basic projectile system
    - Attack cooldown

3. **Enemy Attacking Mechanics**
    - Melee range detection
    - Damage system
    - Attack animations

4. **Resource System**
    - Resource tracking
    - Enemy defeat rewards
    - Placement cost system

5. **Game Loop**
    - Wave spawning system
    - Victory/defeat conditions
    - Game state management

6. **Basic UI**
    - Core game controls
    - Resource display
    - Health/wave indicators

## Active Decisions
1. Using configurable grid system with clear valid/invalid areas
2. Using direct enemy movement without pathfinding
3. Using signal system for event handling
4. Centralizing resource management

## Current Considerations
1. Grid size optimization for mobile
2. Enemy spawn point placement
3. Resource balance for initial prototype
4. UI scaling for different devices
5. Enemy movement behavior tuning
6. Grid visual clarity improvements

## Next Steps
1. Fine-tune defender placement preview
2. Implement wave spawning system
3. Add placement validation feedback
4. Balance enemy movement speed

## Technical Notes
- Grid system now uses export variables for configuration
- Enemy movement uses simple distance-based targeting
- Grid displays full extent with valid placement area highlighted
- Placement preview uses proper coordinate transformations
