# WorldTileMap Implementation

- [x] Created WorldTileMapLayer script that combines ground and wall tilemap functionality
- [x] Updated level.gd to use the new WorldTileMap
- [x] Updated level.tscn to use the new WorldTileMap structure
- [x] Updated defender_placement_manager.gd to work with WorldTileMap
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility for existing code
- [x] Cleaned up old files and nodes (removed grid_system.gd)

This implementation allows level design to be done in the Godot editor using a single WorldTileMap node, which contains both ground and wall tiles. The navigation mesh can be baked using this combined tilemap.

## Benefits
- Simplified level design with a single tilemap for world elements
- Cleaner scene structure
- Easier navigation mesh baking
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
