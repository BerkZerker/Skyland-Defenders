# Skyland Defenders - Refactoring Notes

## Overview

The codebase has been refactored to improve organization, maintainability, and separation of concerns. The main focus was on breaking up the large `game.gd` script into smaller, more focused components.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Manager Scripts

Three new manager scripts have been created to handle specific responsibilities:

- **UIManager (`ui_manager.gd`)**: Handles all UI-related functionality, including updating UI elements, showing/hiding panels, and managing button states.
- **CameraController (`camera_controller.gd`)**: Manages camera movement, panning, and positioning.
- **DefenderPlacementManager (`defender_placement_manager.gd`)**: Handles the logic for placing defenders on the grid, including creating templates, validating placements, and finalizing placements.

### 2. Simplified Game Script

The main `game.gd` script has been significantly simplified:

- Reduced from ~400 lines to ~150 lines
- Now focuses on core game state management and coordination between systems
- Delegates specific responsibilities to the appropriate manager scripts

### 3. Updated Scene Structure

The game scene has been updated to include the new manager nodes, each with their respective scripts attached.

## New Architecture

The new architecture follows a more modular approach:

```
Game (Node2D)
├── Camera2D
├── Level (Node2D)
│   └── TileMapLayer
├── WaveSystem
│   └── SpawnPoints
├── UIManager
├── CameraController
├── DefenderPlacementManager
└── UI (CanvasLayer)
    ├── TopPanel
    ├── BottomPanel
    ├── ControlPanel
    ├── GameOverPanel
    └── VictoryPanel
```

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each script now has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and modify.
2. **Better Organization**: Related functionality is grouped together in dedicated scripts.
3. **Reduced Complexity**: The main game script is now much simpler and easier to understand.
4. **Easier Debugging**: Issues can be isolated to specific components more easily.
5. **Improved Scalability**: New features can be added to the appropriate component without cluttering the main game script.

## Level and TileMapLayer Implementation

The custom grid system has been replaced with Godot's built-in TileMapLayer node, and a new Level scene has been created:

1. **Created Separate Level Scene**:
   - Moved the TileMapLayer into its own scene called `level.tscn`
   - Added a `level.gd` script to manage the level functionality
   - This prepares the game for future custom level loading capabilities

2. **Replaced GridSystem with TileMapLayer**: 
   - Changed the `GridSystem` node to a `TileMapLayer` node in the level scene
   - Created a new `tilemap_grid.gd` script that maintains the same API as the original grid system
   - Updated references in other scripts to work with the TileMapLayer through the Level node

2. **Benefits of Using TileMapLayer**:
   - Uses Godot's built-in functionality instead of custom implementation
   - Better performance and memory usage
   - Easier to extend with additional tile types in the future
   - Provides a foundation for creating custom levels

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Created a programmatic tileset with different tile types (empty, valid, invalid, occupied)
   - Maintained the same grid size and cell size as the original implementation
   - Preserved the same API for other scripts to interact with (get_cell_position, get_grid_position, place_defender, etc.)
   - Updated visual representation to use TileMap cells instead of custom drawing

## Future Improvements

While this refactoring has significantly improved the codebase structure, here are some potential future improvements:

1. **Custom Level Loading**: Implement functionality to load different level layouts from data files
2. **Level Editor**: Create a dedicated level editor scene to design custom levels using the TileMap
3. **Resource Management System**: Create a dedicated system for managing resources
4. **Event System**: Implement a more robust event system to further decouple components
5. **Configuration System**: Move game settings to a configuration file or resource
6. **Save/Load System**: Add functionality to save and load game state
7. **Additional Defender Types**: The modular structure now makes it easier to add different types of defenders
