# Skyland Defenders - Project Status

This document tracks the current status of the Skyland Defenders tower defense game project.

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Core Gameplay Prototype

The project is currently in Phase 1, implementing the core gameplay mechanics for a minimal viable product.

### Implemented Features ✅

**Basic Game Loop**
- ✅ Start game functionality
- ✅ Enemy wave spawning system
- ✅ Defender placement system
- ✅ Victory condition (survive X waves)
- ✅ Game over condition (all defenders destroyed)

**Defender System**
- ✅ Basic ranged defender with attack functionality
- ✅ Automatic targeting of enemies
- ✅ Attack cooldown

**Enemy System**
- ✅ Basic enemy type
- ✅ Enemy movement and pathfinding
- ✅ Enemy attacks

**Map & Placement System**
- ✅ Grid-based placement system
- ✅ Valid/invalid placement visualization

**Resource System**
- ✅ Resources gained from defeating enemies
- ✅ Resources used for placing defenders

**Basic UI**
- ✅ Start Wave, Pause, Restart buttons
- ✅ Resource counter
- ✅ Wave counter
- ✅ Game over and victory screens

**Code Organization**
- ✅ Component-based architecture implementation
- ✅ Organized files into proper directory structure
- ✅ Standardized naming conventions
- ✅ Removed redundant files and implementations
- ✅ Moved level.tscn to scenes/levels/
- ✅ Moved entity scenes to scenes/entities/
- ✅ Created scenes/ui/ directory for future UI scenes
- ✅ Renamed component_*.tscn files to *.tscn
- ✅ Renamed component_*.gd files to *.gd
- ✅ Updated references in scripts to point to new file locations
- ✅ Fixed class name conflicts in scripts

### Component System Architecture

The game now uses a component-based architecture where entities are composed of smaller, reusable components:

**Base Classes**
- ✅ Component (scripts/components/component.gd): Base class for all components
- ✅ Entity (scripts/components/entity.gd): Base class for all game entities that manages components

**Standard Components**
- ✅ HealthComponent: Manages health, damage, and death
- ✅ AttackComponent: Handles attack logic, damage, and cooldowns
- ✅ TargetingComponent: Finds and tracks targets
- ✅ MovementComponent: Handles movement logic
- ✅ VisualComponent: Manages visual representation
- ✅ CollisionComponent: Handles collision detection
- ✅ PlacementComponent: Manages grid-based placement
- ✅ ProjectileComponent: Handles projectile behavior
- ✅ PathfindingComponent: Handles pathfinding for entities
- ✅ HealthBarComponent: Manages health bar visualization

**Entity Types**
- ✅ Defender (scripts/entities/defender.gd): Defender entity using components
- ✅ Enemy (scripts/entities/enemy.gd): Enemy entity using components
- ✅ Projectile (scripts/entities/projectile.gd): Projectile entity using components

### In Progress Features 🔄

**Map & Placement System**
- 🔄 Improved floating island terrain visuals
- 🔄 Multiple island layouts

**UI Improvements**
- 🔄 Better health bar visualization
- 🔄 Improved game over and victory screens

**Enemy System**
- 🔄 Native Godot pathfinding integration

### Planned Next Features 📋

**Defender Variety**
- 📋 Add multiple defender types with different abilities
- 📋 Defender upgrade system

**Enemy Variety**
- 📋 Add multiple enemy types with different behaviors
- 📋 Boss enemies at milestone waves

**Game Balance**
- 📋 Fine-tune resource economy
- 📋 Balance enemy health and damage
- 📋 Balance defender costs and attack power

**Visual Improvements**
- 📋 Improved sprites and animations
- 📋 Visual effects for attacks
- 📋 Background elements and parallax

**Audio**
- 📋 Background music
- 📋 Sound effects for game actions

**Component System Improvements**
- 📋 Component Registry: Create a central registry for component types
- 📋 Serialization: Add support for serializing and deserializing components
- 📋 Component Templates: Create templates for common component configurations
- 📋 Visual Component Editor: Create a visual editor for component-based entities
- 📋 Component Dependencies: Add support for declaring component dependencies

## Known Issues 🐛

- Touch controls and camera offset need fixing
- Resources are currently hardcoded
- Enemy spawn points need implementation

## Next Steps

1. Complete the in-progress features
2. Fix known issues
3. Begin implementing defender variety
4. Add enemy variety
5. Implement visual improvements
6. Add sound effects and music
7. Conduct playtesting and balance adjustments

## Project Milestones

- ✅ **Phase 1 Core Mechanics**: Implement basic tower defense gameplay (In Progress)
- 📋 **Phase 2 Content Expansion**: Add variety of defenders, enemies, and maps
- 📋 **Phase 3 Polish**: Improve visuals, audio, and user experience
- 📋 **Phase 4 Release**: Final testing, optimization, and deployment

## Recent Refactoring

The codebase has been refactored to improve organization, maintainability, and separation of concerns:

1. **Created New Manager Scripts**
   - UIManager (ui_manager.gd): Handles all UI-related functionality
   - CameraController (camera_controller.gd): Manages camera movement and positioning
   - DefenderPlacementManager (defender_placement_manager.gd): Handles defender placement logic

2. **Simplified Game Script**
   - Reduced from ~400 lines to ~150 lines
   - Now focuses on core game state management
   - Delegates specific responsibilities to manager scripts

3. **Updated Scene Structure**
   - Added manager nodes to the game scene
   - Organized entities into appropriate directories

4. **Implemented Component-Based Architecture**
   - Created base Component and Entity classes
   - Implemented standard components for common functionality
   - Converted all entities to use the component system

5. **Level and TileMapLayer Implementation**
   - Created separate Level scene
   - Replaced custom GridSystem with Godot's built-in TileMapLayer
   - Improved performance and extensibility
